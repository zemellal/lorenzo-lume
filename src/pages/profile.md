# Lorenzo Zemella

I am a full-stack web developer with strength in building high performing web apps, APIs, and working with Agile teams in startups. Resourceful developer using the latest stacks for increased performance and speed. As CTO of multiple startups, I managed code reviews and led engineering teams of multiple sizes.
