Guitars and amps I play with. 

<section>

## Electrics

_PRS Silver Sky Rosewood_ is an S-style guitar that caught my attention for a while. I love the balance of vintage feel with modern build and reliability. It's basically a 60s Strat with perfect stability, intonation, and playability. It was perfect right out-of-the-box. I bought this Tungsten model as a used demo right when Covid started, and before prices shot up when everyone decided to learn guitar. 

_EVH Wolfgang Special_ - I have always been a huge fan of Eddie, but only recently started liking the Wolfgang shape. It's a perfect blend of a Les Paul and super Strat, with a Floyd! The pickups sound amazing, the neck and radius feel perfect for any genre, and it's pretty compact and reliable. The Floyd bridge won't let you change tunings easily, just get another guitar, but at least it has the D-tuna. Can't go wrong, and it's so much fun! 

_1998 Fender American Deluxe Strat HSS_ was the first "grown up" guitar I got. It has an amazing greenish aqua finish over the Ash body and a maple neck. It's a solid, modern Strat. This one is currently running EMG active pickups. 

I'm looking at Teles, semi-hollows and LP style guitars for future acquisitions...

## Acoustics

_Orangewood Oliver Jr Mahogany_ is a great value and plays great. It doesn't have the full depth and presence of larger guitars, but it's awesome to jam informally on. 

_Yamaha Classical_ belonged to my mom when she was teaching kindergarten. The frets are tiny, the neck is a little bowed, but I love the classic nylon sound from it. It's also the first guitar I played and learned on.

## Amps

_Orange Rocker 15 combo_ is an all-tube 10 inch combo amp. I love its simplicity, tone, and built-in attenuator so I can get tube distortion and saturation at lower volumes. It also has an effects loop where I usually run a delay and looper. 

_Yamaha THR5_ is a tabletop 2x3" modeling amp. It can plug into the wall or run on batteries. I love the simple layout and has all the amp models and effects I need to practice with. No need to navigate menus and settings to start playing!
