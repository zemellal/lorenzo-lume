Photography equipment I use and have collected over the years. I'm working on self-hosting photo albums, but for now you can see some work on my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/lzemella/).

## Digital

These are all Nikon for now. I've used Nikon since 2007, but have used and enjoy Canon and Fuji. If I were shooting professionally, I would probably switch to Canon (or upgrade to a couple of Nikon Z9s), and if I wanted something even smaller, I would get a Fuji system. 

_Nikon Z6_ is my main "real" camera when the iPhone doesn't cut it. It's a killer deal refurbished or used, has 4K30, decent auto focus, and is relatively compact for full-frame. 

_Nikon D600_ I had 2 of these when I was shooting weddings on the weekends after graduating from school. I kept one because it's worth more keeping it than selling it. 

_Nikon Z 24-120 f4_ is the main lens. It covers a very useful focal range with a consistent f4. Lighter weight and good value compared to the 2.8 zoom. 

_Nikon Z 40 f2_ this lens replaced my very amazing Z 50 1.8. It's not as sharp, but it's lighter, smaller, cheaper, and has decent character. I also prefer the slightly wider 40mm as an everyday lens. And it's a whole stop faster than any 2.8 zoom. 

_Nikon F 70-200 f4_ is a great lens for landscapes and general telephoto. 

_Nikon F 200-500 f5.6_ is so good for the value. Enough range for most things... I pretty much use it in the 400-500mm range. I bought this lens once, sold it, and now have another copy thanks to a gift from a good friend.

## Film

_Nikon FE2_ is so satisfying to use. It's bulletproof, has an insanely huge viewfinder compared to anything digital, and just needs a tiny battery to run the meter and shutter for years. Sure, you need to buy and develop film, but it's a camera that will outlast me. I bought this for $89 in 2008. 

_Yashica MAT_ is a twin lens reflex medium format camera. 6x6 film is expensive but so forgiving and natural looking. I've mostly shot Velvia 50 with this for vivid landscapes and street, but also some Ilford HP5 B&W film.  I bought this for $76 in 2008.
